# Fake News Detection

### About This Project
- I chose to do this project to improve my Data Science skills.
- This project is focused on my learning and development.
- This project uses TfidfVectorizer.
- Fake News can be defined as news items that may contain false and/or exaggerated claims, and may end up being viralized by algorithms, and users may end up in a filter bubble.
- Fake News is often used to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas.

#### Project Learning Notes
- TfidfVectorizer: TfidfVectorizer converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features. 
  - Term Frequency (TF): The number of times a word appears in a document. A higher value means it occurs more often than others. 
  - Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Words that occur many times in a document, but also occur many times, but maybe irrelevant. IDF measures how significant a term is to the entire body.
- Passive Aggressive Classifier: Passive Aggressive algorithms are online learning algorithms that are passive for correct classification outcomes and aggressive for miscalculations, updating to correct the loss without converging. Their goal is to make updates that minimize changes to the weight vector norm.
